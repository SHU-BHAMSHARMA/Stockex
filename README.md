```

Indicator weights:

| -------------------- | ------ |
| RSI                  | 1.5    |
| MACD                 | 1.3    |
| Ichimoku             | 1.2    |
| Order Blocks         | 1.4    |
| Bollinger Bands      | 1.0    |
| Support & Resistance | 1.0    |
| Other Indicators     | 0.8    |

The weighted average is converted into a score between **-100** and **100**.
